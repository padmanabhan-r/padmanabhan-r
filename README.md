### 👋 Hey, I’m Padmanabhan

A person-shaped process running on limited RAM and excessive curiosity.  
The universe is annoyingly large; my mental cache is tragically finite.  
Stray ideas leak into `/tmp`,  
so the useful ones get version-controlled here.

I build Applied AI, agentic systems, and software that usually does what it’s told—  
after sufficient interrogation of data and a few strategic print statements.

Lately, I’ve been **tinkering with Edge AI**, wiring together cameras, bulbs, and whatever hardware is lying around the house, and seeing how far I can push intelligence closer to the edge.

When I’m not coding, I’m making loud noises with guitars and drums,  
or losing boss fights “to understand the mechanics.”

👾 Mostly harmless. Frequently caffeinated. Relentlessly compiling.
