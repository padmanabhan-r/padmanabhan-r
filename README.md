### 👋 Hey, I'm Padmanabhan

A person-shaped process running on limited RAM and excessive curiosity.  
The universe is annoyingly large; my brain cache is annoyingly small.  
Stray thoughts overflow the `/tmp` directory of my mind,  
so I store the salvageable ones here — version-controlled, finally.

I wrangle AI, poke at data until it confesses its secrets,  
and build systems that behave *almost* like I intended.

When I'm not coding, I’m making loud noises with guitars and drums,  
or losing boss fights for “research purposes.”

👾 Mostly harmless. Sometimes caffeinated. Always compiling.
