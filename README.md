### 👋 Hey, I'm Padmanabhan  

I write code of dubious authenticity.

A person-shaped process running on limited RAM and excessive curiosity.  
The universe is annoyingly vast; my brain cache is frustratingly small.  
Stray thoughts overflow the `/tmp` directory of my mind,  
so the recoverable ones get version-controlled here.

I wrangle AI, interrogate data until it reveals its secrets,  
and build systems that behave *almost* like I intended.

When I'm not coding, I'm making loud noises with guitars and drums,  
or losing boss fights “for research.”

👾 Mostly harmless. Sometimes caffeinated. Always compiling.
