### 👋 Hi. I’m Padmanabhan.

**AI Systems Builder | Technical Product @ Ford Motor Company**  
I build production AI systems. Edge to cloud. Fast loops, slow loops.

---

### ⚙️ What I Build

- Enterprise AI systems for **document intelligence, compliance, and cost reduction**
- **Non-standard RAG methods** for large (300+ page) technical documents
- **Agentic workflows** for requirements analysis, benchmarking, and decision support
- **Edge AI & real-time feedback systems** using audio, sensors, and embedded hardware

Outside work: Raspberry Pi, audio DSP, electronics, and Edge AI.  
If it can be measured, it can be improved.

### 🎸 Current Pet Project

**FretCoach** — real-time guitar practice, powered by AI.  
Feedback while you play. Not after.

- On-device audio analysis (milliseconds)
- AI coaching & reflection (seconds)
- Edge hardware + cloud backend
- Screen, voice, and ambient light as feedback channels

> Most tools correct mistakes.  
> **This prevents them.**

### 🎵 Off the Clock

- 🎸 Guitar & drums (metal, prog)
- 🔁 Feedback loops everywhere
- 🛠️ If it runs on a Pi, it’s fair game
