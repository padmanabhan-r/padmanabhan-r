### 👋 Hey, I'm Padmanabhan

**Hands-on AI Systems Builder | Technical Product @ Ford Motor Company**  
I design and ship production AI systems — from edge devices to cloud platforms.

---

### 🔧 What I Actually Build

- **Enterprise AI systems** for document intelligence, regulatory compliance, and cost reduction  
- **Custom RAG-style methods** for large (300+ page) technical documents  
- **Agentic AI workflows** for requirements analysis, benchmarking, and decision support  
- **Edge AI & real-time feedback systems** using audio, sensors, and embedded hardware  

Outside work, I’m constantly tinkering with **Raspberry Pi, audio DSP, electronics, and Edge AI** — turning ideas into working systems.

### 🎸 Featured Project

**FretCoach — AI-Powered Real-Time Guitar Practice System**  
A feedback-first practice system that listens as you play and intervenes in milliseconds.

- On-device audio analysis (fast loop)
- AI coaching & analytics (slow loop)
- Edge hardware + cloud platform
- Screen, voice, and ambient light as feedback channels

> Most tools correct mistakes.  
> **FretCoach prevents them.**

### 🎵 Beyond Work

- 🎸 Guitar & drums (metal, prog, anything with riffs)
- 🧠 Obsessed with feedback loops — in music, learning, and systems
- 🛠️ If it can run on a Pi, I probably tried it
